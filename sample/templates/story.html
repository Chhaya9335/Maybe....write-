    <h1> "The Last Letter"</h1>
    <p>
        In a small coastal village, lived a retired postman named Gopal. He had spent 40 years delivering letters—walking miles, through sun and rain, to connect hearts. Even after retirement, he kept all the unclaimed or returned letters in a wooden trunk, as if they were pieces of unfinished stories.

One evening, a young woman named Meera moved into the house next to his. She was a writer, but suffering from writer’s block. They became friends over evening tea. Meera was fascinated by Gopal’s stories of letters — love letters, farewell notes, letters from soldiers who never returned.

One day, Gopal showed her a special letter—never opened, never delivered. It had no return address, only the words:
“To the one I never got to say goodbye.”

Meera, curious and inspired, wrote a fictional story based on that letter. The story became her first published book: “The Last Letter.” It gained attention and moved readers deeply.

Months later, an old woman came to the village. She had read Meera’s book, and claimed that letter was written by her late husband before he died in a train accident. She never knew he tried to reach her one last time.

With tears, she held the letter. Though late, she finally received her goodbye.</p>

<h4><p>Moral of the Story:</p></h4>
Sometimes, even lost words find their way home.
Never underestimate the power of stories—or the human heart’s desire for closure.</p>
