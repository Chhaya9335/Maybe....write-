   <h2>Story</h2>
<h1>Self Interview</h1>
<h3>"Are my choices really that bad??"</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, I sit alone, almost interviewing myself in my head — asking questions no one else dares to ask me. The biggest one is always: “Are my choices really that bad?” I don't ask this with bitterness, but with genuine confusion. Because so many times, I’ve chosen with love, with passion, with all my heart — and yet, the outcomes have been the opposite of what I hoped.
 I’ve never been the kind of girl who followed the crowd. I always followed my heart, even when it made no sense. But lately, I’ve begun to wonder — maybe that’s exactly the problem.
</p>

<p>
I remember the first thing I ever truly loved — sketching. I would spend hours blending pencils , trying to turn my emotions into strokes on a canvas. I thought it was my escape, my calling. But the more I sketched, the more I was told, “You’re not doing it right,” or “This doesn’t look professional.” Slowly, what I loved began to feel like a mistake. So I gave it up. 
</p>

<p>
Then came photography. I told myself, "Maybe I’m not meant to create from nothing, maybe I’m meant to capture what’s already beautiful." I bought an old camera with the money I had saved, and wandered around the city, clicking pictures of sunsets, strangers, abandoned buildings — things that spoke to me in silence. But once again, people said, “There’s no story in these.” The camera went back in the drawer. Another dream tucked away.
</p>

<p>
And love? Don’t even get me started. The boy I once thought I would spend my life with — he turned out to be a lesson, not a partner. I gave him everything: my time, my trust, my heart. In return, I received silence, confusion, and eventually, betrayal. I thought I had finally chosen right. Turns out, I was just another chapter in his unfinished story. 
</p>



<p>
One of the first major choices I made was my career path. I fell in love with a course — something creative, something that spoke to my soul. I studied hard, imagined myself walking into that classroom, meeting people who shared the same passion. But I didn’t get in. Maybe it was the competition, or maybe just bad timing. I don’t know. Instead, I was admitted into a completely different course — one I had never even considered, one I never liked. Throughout the years of studying it, I passed every exam, scored well, got praise from my professors — but deep down, I never enjoyed a moment of it. I never felt connected. I was doing well, yes, but not living well.
</p>

<p>
Then there was college — I had big dreams. I wanted to get into one of the best colleges in the world. I researched, imagined myself walking across beautiful campuses, taking photos, laughing in libraries, living the dream. I also had a list of places I never wanted to go — not because they were bad, but simply because my mind had already rejected them. Unfortunately, the universe had its own plans. I didn’t get into my dream college. Instead, I landed in one of the colleges I had promised myself I would never go to.
</p>

<p>
At first, I was heartbroken. It felt like another wrong turn. But slowly, the experience humbled me. The teachers there were not just knowledgeable, they were kind. They saw potential in me that I had forgotten existed. I made friends I never expected to make — people who challenged me, changed me, and taught me lessons about life, loyalty, and growing up. That place, which I once saw as a mistake, became one of the most important chapters in my story.
</p>

<p>
It’s strange, isn’t it? How we think we know what’s best for us — but sometimes what we avoid is exactly what we need. It makes me wonder: were my choices really bad, or was I just blind to the blessings in disguise?
</p>

<p>
Even outside academics, it’s been the same pattern. I’ve trusted people who didn’t deserve it. I’ve poured my time into friendships that drained me. I’ve chosen places to work where I thought I would shine, but ended up burning out. But even in those mistakes, I grew. I learned how to speak up. I learned how to say no. I learned the value of protecting my peace.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I wonder if the problem is me — if I’m cursed to fall in love with the wrong things, the wrong people, the wrong paths. I try to convince myself that it’s okay, that mistakes are part of growth. But how many wrong turns before I find the right road? How many times can a person rebuild themselves before they stop believing in the blueprint?
</p>

<p>
But even as I question myself, a small voice inside me whispers, “You loved deeply. You tried. That counts.” Maybe it’s not that my choices are bad — maybe the world just isn’t gentle with hearts like mine. Maybe loving the wrong things teaches me how to recognize what’s truly right. Maybe it’s not about having a perfect taste, but having the courage to taste life at all.
</p>
<p>
So, when I look back, I realize something important — maybe my choices weren’t always wrong. Maybe they just didn’t turn out the way I planned. But they led me to experiences I needed. They helped me become someone stronger, more aware, more alive.
 But I wouldn’t want to erase the lessons. I wouldn’t trade the people I met, the strength I found, or the wisdom I gained. Life doesn't always give us what we ask for, but it often gives us what we need — even if we don't see it at first.
</p>

<p>
So, are my choices really that bad? Maybe not. Maybe they were just... human. And being human means choosing with hope, even when there are no guarantees. I still believe in my heart, even if it has led me down difficult paths — because those paths have made me who I am.
</p>

<p>
So, if this is a self-interview, and I have to give myself an honest answer, here it is: Yes, I’ve chosen wrong. More than once. Maybe I’ll do it again. But no, I’m not sorry. Because every wrong choice has brought me closer to understanding who I am — a girl who loves fearlessly, even when the world tells her not to.
</p>

<p>
And that, I think, is a choice I’ll never regret.
