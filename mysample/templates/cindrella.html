    <h1> Cinderella</h1>
    <h2> A Girl’s Life Changes with a Glass Slipper</h2><p>
        Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, lived a sweet and kind girl named Cinderella. After her mother passed away, her father remarried a proud and selfish woman who had two daughters of her own. When Cinderella’s father also died, she was left alone with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters, who treated her very badly.

They made Cinderella do all the chores—cleaning, cooking, scrubbing floors, and tending the fire. They gave her old, ragged clothes and never showed her kindness. But Cinderella remained gentle, patient, and kind-hearted.One day, a royal invitation arrived. The king had decided to hold a grand ball at the palace so that the prince could choose a bride. Every young woman in the kingdom was invited.

Cinderella was excited and hoped she could go. But her stepmother laughed at her and said,
“You? Go to the ball? In those rags?”
Instead, she made Cinderella help her and her daughters get ready in fancy dresses and jewels.

After they left, Cinderella sat alone and wept.Just then, a gentle light appeared and a kind fairy godmother stood before her.
“Don’t cry, dear child,” she said. “You shall go to the ball.”

With a wave of her magic wand, she turned:

A pumpkin into a golden carriage

Mice into horses

A lizard into a coachman

And Cinderella’s rags into a beautiful gown, with sparkling glass slippers

But the fairy godmother warned,
“The magic will end at midnight. You must return before then.”

 The Ball
Cinderella arrived at the palace. Everyone was amazed by her beauty, especially the prince, who danced with her all evening.
She was so happy that she lost track of time. Suddenly, the clock began to chime midnight!

Cinderella ran out of the palace, and as she did, she lost one glass slipper on the steps. She didn’t stop to pick it up.

 The Prince's Search
The next day, the prince set out to find the mysterious girl. He had only the glass slipper she had left behind. He declared,
“I will marry the girl whose foot fits this slipper.”

He and his men traveled to every house. The stepsisters tried to squeeze their feet in, but it was no use. Finally, they arrived at Cinderella’s house.

Her stepmother tried to hide her, but Cinderella asked, “May I try it too?”

The slipper fit perfectly, and the prince knew she was the one. He took her hand and said, “You are my true love.”

💍 Happily Ever After
Cinderella married the prince in a grand royal wedding, and they lived happily ever after. Her kindness, courage, and gentle spirit had brought her a beautiful new life.
