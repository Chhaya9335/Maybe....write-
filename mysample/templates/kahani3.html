    <h2> Story</h2>
    <h1>"Wrenches and Code"</h1>


<h3>Characters:</h3>

Meera Verma – A curious, determined small-town girl who dreams of becoming a mechanical engineer.<br>

Papa (Raghav Verma) – A humble schoolteacher, Meera’s biggest supporter..<br>

Arshad Sir – Her inspiring school science teacher..<br>
Dr. A.P.J.Kalam - Her idol, whom she followed ..<br>

Ayaan - Her quiet but brilliant classmate and future colleague..<br>

<h3>🌱 Beginning: A Girl and Her dreams </h3>
Meera was a brilliant girl as every teacher said that, She was interested in reading and writing stories, novels and some textuals description but, 
Ever since Meera could saw the Rockets, she was fascinated by how things worked — Rockets, planes, Missiles and Defence Systems.
She wasn’t interested in dolls — she loved aeroplanes, engines, and screwdrivers. Her favorite memory? Sitting beside her father in the veranda, fixing their old table fan, while he explained how motors worked.

At 16, she stood in front of her school project – a hand-built mini  project on Distilattion of water, told everyone how the mechaics done without anyone's support – and proudly said:
“One day, I’ll build machines that matter.”

Her dream was clear: IIT Mechanical Engineering.
The problem? Life had other blueprints.

<h3>🛣 The Road Gets Twisty </h3>

Meera worked hard. Woke up at 5 AM, studied late into the night. But tragedy struck. Her inner strength feels weakness  during her Class 12 boards.
As she is worried about failure.

Meera did her best —  studying that much  possible — but her results? Below the IIT cutoff.

The mechanical dream began to crack.

Family and society pressure mounted. Engineering was still possible — but luck's desires. Her uncle suggested:
“Try Computer Science, Meera. Software is the future. Better placements, easier life.”

Her heart didn’t agree.

But her fear to failed in Life , her dream to feel parents proud and serve for the Nations, and the need for stability forced her to do.

And so — the girl who once dreamed of machines, entered a world of code.

<h3>💻 The New World: Software Engineering </h3>

Meera walked into her first programming class with a heavy heart.

Loops? Functions? Debugging?

She hated it. She missed the smell of grease, the feel of metal, the sound of tools.
But something changed when she met Ayaan, the quiet topper in her batch, who showed her how code could also build — not machines, but solutions.

He told her one day,
“You don’t have to let go of your mechanical soul, Meera. Just… translate it into logic.”

That night, she created her first project - to assembles the historic texts and NewCreations in terms of stories, poems, and thoughts by owned and others. It ran on JavaScript.

And she smiled — the first real smile in months.

<h3>🌟 Becoming a Builder — Just in a Different Way </h3>

Years passed. Meera became one of the top students in her batch. Her final-year project?
A smart repair assistant app for rural mechanics — coded by her, inspired by her childhood, and tested in her father’s old garage.

It won her a national award.
<pre>
At her first job interview, when asked,
“Why did you choose software?”
She answered:
“I didn’t choose it. Life chose it for me. But I made it mine.”
</pre>

<h3>🏁 Ending: Destiny, Redefined </h3>

Today, Meera works as a software engineer in Bengaluru.
But on weekends, she volunteers at a government ITI college — teaching mechanical students how to combine machines with code.

In her office drawer, she keeps her father’s old wrench — rusted but precious.

Because dreams may shift, but passion never dies.

<pre><h3>🖋 Final Note: </h3><i>
 She wanted to build machines.
Life made her build futures instead.
She is not just a software engineer.
She is a mechanical heart with a digital mind.</i></pre>
