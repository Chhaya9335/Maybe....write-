  <h2>Fictional Story</h2>
  <h1> "From Poster to Past: The Idol She Left Behind" </h1>
    
    <p>

<h3>Characters:</h3>

Aarohi Sharma – A 19-year-old journalism student, bright, curious, emotionally deep.<br>

Aarav Malhotra – A once-beloved Bollywood superstar idolized by millions, including young Aarohi.

<h3>📝 Story Begins:</h3>

When Aarohi was eight, her bedroom walls were covered with Aarav Malhotra's movie posters. She danced to his songs in the living room, mimicked his dialogues in front of the mirror, and believed he was the perfect hero — brave, kind, and flawless. He was her childhood sun, lighting up every dark day.

As she grew older, her fanhood matured into adoration. She defended him in debates, collected interviews, and cried when he cried on screen.

But that love shattered on one rainy July evening.


---

<h3>💥 The Turning Point:</h3>

At 17, Aarohi interned with a small media agency. Her first real assignment: cover the backstage chaos at a glamorous award night. Excited, she finally got a glimpse behind the screen — and into the truth.

Backstage, she saw Aarav — the icon of her childhood — drunken, arrogant, and verbally abusive to his assistant. He tossed his trophy aside, insulted his makeup artist, and snapped, "I don’t need fans. I own them."

Aarohi froze.

The man she once believed in with all her heart was real — but not right.

That night, she tore down every poster in her room.


---

<h3>🔥 Hating the Idol:</h3>

From then on, Aarohi didn’t just stop loving Aarav — she hate him.

She couldn’t stand hearing his voice in public. She avoided his films. When friends praised him, she’d say, “You don’t know the real him.”

But deeper inside, it wasn't just hate. It was betrayal. She didn’t hate the actor — she hated the lie.


---

<h3>🎙 A Final Encounter:</h3>

Two years later, as a student journalist, Aarohi got a  invition  to a private celebrity panel.

Aarav Malhotra was the guest speaker.

When the Q&A opened, she stood up. Calm but trembling inside, she asked,
“Do you ever think about the young fans who believed you were better than you really are?”

Aarav paused. His usual charm cracked. He looked down.
“Sometimes,” he said, “I wish I had lived up to the image they made of me. But I didn’t. I couldn't.”

Aarohi sat down. No applause. No smiles.

But that night, she didn’t feel hate anymore — just a quiet acceptance that heroes are human. And sometimes, the illusion was hers to begin with.


---

<h3>🌙 Ending:</h3>

Back in her room, Aarohi didn’t put the posters back.
But she didn’t burn them either.

She placed one, folded, inside her old diary — beside a note:

<pre><i> “You were my light once.
You failed me.
But I outgrew needing you perfect.”</i></pre>

<h3>Moral?</h3>
Sometimes we outgrow the people we once admired — not because we change, but because they do. And that’s okay.
