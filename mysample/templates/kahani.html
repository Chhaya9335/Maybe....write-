  <h3> Story</h3>
  <h1> Unspoken Innocance </h1>
    
    <p>
   This is the story of two girls, Ariba Khan and Priya Sharma, who came from their previous schools to get admitted to St. Public School, Anand Vihar, Delhi.

They got admission in 9th standard. Their new session started on 4th July, but they met on 15th July because Priya was known as the bunker of the class. She was always lazy when it came to doing work, especially related to studies.

On the other hand, Ariba was very sincere, intelligent, obedient, and well-mannered. She never missed a day of school. Priya was also intelligent, but not sincere about studies and always had a chill attitude. Both were toppers in their previous classes.

When they met for the first time, both were silent—like most new students in a new school. As they started coming to school regularly, some misunderstandings happened between them. They began to treat each other as rivals. Even teachers started referring to them as “official enemies.”

However, among all the teachers, there was one who looked strict but was good in nature. He always tried to make sure the girls didn’t remain enemies. He would make them sit together during his classes so they could understand each other better. He used to say, “You both have to sit together in my period.”

Gradually, almost every teacher started telling them to sit together. So they started sitting together from the beginning of the school day to the end—mainly because Ariba didn't like being scolded and would cry easily if any teacher shouted at her. She was very soft-hearted. Priya, though careless sometimes, didn’t want Ariba to suffer because of her, so she agreed to sit with her.

Over time, sitting together made them good listeners and better friends. They started sharing almost everything with each other. Priya still didn’t like talking to teachers much and just did what she felt like, while Ariba always did what the teachers said and believed in doing the right thing.

By the end of class 9, they had become best friends and also toppers of the class.

When the new session for class 10 began, the school was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government imposed a nationwide lockdown to protect the citizens. This lockdown continued for 6 to 7 months.

After the pandemic, classes resumed. As expected, Priya again joined in October, though the school had reopened in September. Ariba had insisted that Priya come back soon so she wouldn’t fall behind, and because Ariba was feeling lonely, being not very talkative by nature.

Then came their pre-board exams. Both appeared for the exams. They scored good marks—at least according to Priya. But Ariba cried very hard, feeling that her scores were not up to the mark. Priya, trying to hold back her own tears, did her best to comfort her friend and told her that marks didn’t matter that much.

Because of Priya's care and support, Ariba felt a little better and promised herself to do her best next time.

After a one-week holiday, they met again. Ariba brought a gift for Priya. Priya was surprised and asked, “Why are you giving me a gift? My birthday has already passed!” Ariba replied with a smile,

<b>“Is a birthday the only occasion to give someone a gift? I brought this to appreciate your support and your nature.”</b>

When Priya opened the gift, she found a beautiful watch. She praised Ariba’s choice and said she really loved it.

After that day, every teacher began referring to them as best friends. One teacher even teased them:

<b>“Are you two really best friends now? Or still enemies?”
Everyone laughed and enjoyed the moment.</b>

They were always seen together during lunch and around the school. Priya became a little more sincere, and Ariba became a little more cool and fun—not the boring girl she used to be.

One day, they met near school. Ariba came on her bicycle, while Priya came by auto. Ariba, being a bit naughtier now, asked Priya for a ride. Priya agreed immediately. But as they started, they both fell into a spot with dirty water, and their dresses got messed up. They were late for school that day.

The teacher asked why Ariba was late—she was always on time. Then he looked at Priya and joked,

“Did you make Ariba a latecomer too?”

Both of them stayed silent, trying to control their laughter.

At the end of the school day, Ariba again asked for a ride. This time, Priya thought for a moment but agreed. That ride turned out to be a wonderful moment for both of them.

Later, their second pre-board exams were held. Again, both scored good marks. Ariba still felt a bit low but didn’t break down—she fought for her strength.

Before the final board exams, they got two weeks off to prepare. After a lot of hard work, they scored excellent marks.

On the last day of school, <b>they wrote letters to each other, capturing their journey from enemies to best friends.</b>

After 10th grade, they tried their best to get admitted to the same school for senior secondary education. But maybe destiny had something else planned—they ended up in different schools.

Now they talk less, and the distance has grown… but their memories remain strong, and their bond is unforgettable.
